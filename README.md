# Real-time object recognition using a FPGA board
ACTIVE (from june 2024 until june 2025)

## Abstract
This is a final degree project from my mechatronic engineering degree. The objective is to recognize objects in real time by applying filters and other algorithms using a FPGA board, the Sipeed Tang Nano 20K. This board uses a Gowin chip with its own IDE. 
There are three main stages.

  - 1st: Learn how to use the Gowin IDE with their oscilloscope analyzer, do simple programs, and verify how the chip works.
  
  - 2nd: With images stored on the board, apply filters and improve the algorithm.
  
  - 3rd: Configure a camera to read images in real-time and do the object recognition stage.
